# Version of android-tools. Not to be confused with
# version of the project/repository, which is located in
# VERSION.txt. These two are identical most of the time,
# but this project may need to release faster than
# android-tools to fix some bugs for example. When that
# happens, the version in VERSION.txt will include a
# p<num> suffix, whereas the version in this file
# will remain the same (it will still contain the version
# of android-tools AdbWinApi is targeting).
35.0.2
