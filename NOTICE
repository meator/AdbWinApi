found at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development.git/

license in a LICENSE file in the repository, in prebuilt release archives and
in source release archives.

In comparison to Google's original project, this project makes the following
changes:
- Several patches are applied on top of Google's code. Some of these patches
  originate from https://github.com/msys2/adbwinapi . They can be found in the
  build_template/subprojects/packagefiles/diff_files/ directory in the code
  repository (not in released source archives).
- A Meson build system is added, including infrastructure that generates it,
  CI/CD workflows, Meson Wrap integration and documentation of the build
  process.
- Prebuilt release archives and source archives are provided as release
  artifacts.
- Released source archives only include the host/ directory of the
  android/platform/development.git repository as this directory contains the
  source code and supplementary files for AdbWinApi and AdbWinUsbApi.

  The released source files also include the Meson build system and patches
  described above.
